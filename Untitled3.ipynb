        "Macintosh portable computers which are abbreviated as ‘Mac’ is a line of computers produced by Apple. The aim of this report is to propose a technique to increase the sales of Apple Mac Series with respective to the smart phone portfolio of Apple. These desktops/laptops are state-of-the-art with a wide variety of features. The technology proposed to achieve this task is to carry out sentimental analysis on available data followed by further analysis. The objective of this research is to further reduce financial losses. Through this methodology, we aim to improve the overall sales of Apple product portfolio. Furthermore, future trends can be predicted through this model using the data that is collected from Twitter. The overall sentiment of collected data is analysed and classified into various emotions by utilising the hashtag “Apple”, ”iPhone” and ”Macbook” . By understanding the overall sentiment of users, it can be used to further iterate Apple’s Macbook line of products in order to boost sales.\n",

        "Apple Inc. is an enterprise that was founded in the year 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. The hardware portfolio of Apple Inc. includes smart phones, tablets, desktops smart watches, Music devices as we all Apple TV. Under the strong leadership of Steve Jobs, the company grew in innovation with record sales in their product offerings. After the death of Steve, the company begin to decline in terms of sales and innovation.  One of the first products to be developed by Apple was the Apple Lisa in the year 1978. This was followed by Apple II in which was purchased by enterprises, small businesses, schools as well as homes. After years of iterations, the first MacBook Pro was produced by Apple in the year 2006. In the year 2008, Apple introduced MacBook Air; the “World’s Thinnest NoteBook”. As years progressed, Apple ensured that multiple iterations were made to make it attractive for the users. Unfortunately, one of the apple products that began to decline in post-Steve Jobs era is the Apple MacBook series. The below graph illustrates the decline in sales that has occurred from the year 2015. \n",

        "The below figure shows the number of products that has been dispatched and shipped from year 2013 to year 2019. The graph shows a significant decline of shipments from 2.19 million to 1.59 million in the period from 2017 to 2019. The reasons for these depreciations needs to evaluated and corrected in order for Apple to maintain their market value.\n",

        "\n",
        "Sentimental Analysis is used in this project in order to increase the sales of Apple MacBook series as par with the sales of its smart watch series. As part of this technique, the data is collected through an API created on Twitter for R Studio. Through this technique, the overall sentiment regarding the existing lines of Macbook products can be understood and further insights can be evaluated to improve the product offerings. \n",
        "\n",
        "**CURRENT METHODOLOGIES:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Apple Inc. has an existing system in place to predict its sales called the ‘Judgemental Approach’. As per a report release by Apple Inc.  (Apple Computer Inc., 2019), the company includes a ‘Bottom Up’ approach where it take feedbacks from its Customers and use this data to make further sales forecasts. It was using this technique that the company was able to further innovate on its products which increased its demand in the market. \n",
        "\n",
        "**PROJECT SIGNIFICANCE:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Through this proposal, Apple Inc. can understand their customer’s opinion on Apple MacBook Series and further iterate the product to boost sales. This would assist the company not to reduce loss in revenue. As part of this project, data of previous year sales are collected to forecast future sales. Through proposed model, profit revenue is targeted to increase by increasing its Sales revenue. This can be done only by ensuring sales growth per launch of every new product. The proposed system aims to assist in this task.\n",

        "**PROJECT INNOVATION:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Although there are conventional methods existing to understand customer’s feedbacks of a company’s website, this proposal suggests a more emotional and direct expression of opinion through sentimental analysis. This would be done by analysing the emotion with which the latest Apple MacBook released in May 2019 was accepted. This information would be retrieved through collecting tweets based on relevant key words. Further research would be on analysing the time of the year when maximum sales of the product is done and the reasons behind it. Based on this study, the company can further improvise and launch products during that season.\n",
        "\n",
        "**PROPOSED SOLUTION:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to collect necessary data, it is extracted from Twitter using a API through R Studio environment. Using keywords such as “Apple”,”Mac”,”MacBook” This collected data is raw and needs to cleaned and pre-processed for further analysis.  The collected tweets contains a lot of unnecessary elements such as website URLs, punctuations, stop-words and numbers.  Once data pre-processing is done through R-Studio, the cleaned data is used for classification. For this task, the ”Orange” tool is used. Multiple machine learning algorithms are implemented such as Neural Networks, Naïve-Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor Classifiers. This tool is chosen for this project as it is user-friendly and easy to analyse data followed by data mining. The below snapshot shows the workflow implemented in this tool for data processing.\n",

        "To carry out analysis techniques, a training set is required. This dataset is used to build a prediction model to predict possible outputs of an unknown dataset. There are two outputs that are being predicted in this system; Positive words that is represented as 1 and negative words that is represented as 0. The training dataset used in this system is the previous year transactions of Apple products with defined positive and negative outputs. The cleaned dataset collected from Twitter is used as the Testing Set. By creating the prediction model and predicting outputs, the proportion of emotions from the extracted tweets is studied. This information is used to further create the model. The key words that are used more frequently related to the MacBook series is evaluated from the tweets as well. This can be represented through a WordCloud diagram generated through the R-Studio.  If the number of negative comments are higher than that of positive, it is understood that the product requires further iterations to increase sales.\n",

By comprehending these reasons, the company will be to iterate its products and services and moreover take initiatives to launch these products during peak purchasing seasons to increase revenue. The proposed model is based on previous sales records as well as the sentiment involved in it and can be used to visualise and forecast sales.

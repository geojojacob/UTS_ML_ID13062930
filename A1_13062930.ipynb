        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Since these applications are very crucial, it is imperative that the detection process is highly accurate. Eye detection is based on analyzing several characteristics of the eye such as the iris color, eye size, eye width, and its boldness. But analysing these characteristics may be affected due to different factors, which in turn degrades the accuracy detection. The accuracy of eye detection methods are affected by the following factors:\n",
        "1.\tVariations in face pose\n",
        "2.  Eye Occlusions\n",
        "3.  Use of glasses and\n",
        "4.  Illumination variation.\n",
        "\n",
        "These factors make it hard to detect eyes clearly from facial images. To improve this accuracy, the authors have researched and developed a hybrid model integrating two classifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two sections to the processing done in this mode. The first section is a data analytics section where data from multiple databases are analyzed. This involves utilizing the concepts of big-data, data pre-processing, and classification of data. For data classification, a combination of both CNN and SVM classifiers are used.\n",
        "\n",
        " The CNN classifier acts as a feature extractor while the SVM classifier carries out the final classification of eye images. The CNN classifier is used after training to extract various eye features. For feature extraction, the CNN classifier provides seven layers for the processing which are the input layer, convolution layer, sub-sampling layer, and the output layer. Here, successive convolutions and subsampling are done. Each layer of CNN extractor has two-dimensional planes called feature maps which further contains neurons. Tree kernels are used in this scenario where neurons having the same feature map, have the same kernel and associated weights. Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) transformation is utilized in the convolution layer to obtain the final values of the Feature maps.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the final classification stage done by SVM classifiers, distinguishing between the eye and non-eye images is done. The SVM classifier is used to verify eyes. SVM is a quick solution for this problem as it uses a hyperplane as the decision surface to differentiate between two classes. To minimize miscalculation error and maximize the area for the decision surface, kernel functions such as the polynomial, Gaussian, and RBF functions are utilized. \n",
        "\n",
        "Before the feature extraction and classification stage, the authors have introduced a new section of processing called the Eye Variance Filter (EVF) which does the initial detection of eye regions. The intensity variation of an eyes’ grey part is used to detect whether a region is an eye image or not. The EVF uses correlation to find the most probable eye image areas which are calculated using the variance between eye and non-eye images. The output of this section is hence called ‘candidate eyes.’\n",
        "\n",
        "The authors have then used the model that they have created on various databases such as BioID, IMM, FERET, as well as ORL face databases. They have further compared this model with other existing eye detection models such as the models proposed by Yu et al. (YU, LIN, and WANG, 2016), Hassaballah et al. (Hassaballah, Kanazawa, Ido and Ido, 2010), and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "The principles of EVF, CNN, and SVM are taken from this paper as well from various other journals and detailed in this report. Moreover, the process of eye detection and experimental results are elaborated in detail. "
